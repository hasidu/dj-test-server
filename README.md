# La Foresta Events Website

This is a modern events website built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, inspired by La Foresta events.

## Project Structure

- `/src/app`: Contains Next.js App Router pages
- `/src/components`: Reusable UI components
- `/src/data`: Data models and sample events
- `/public/images`: Image assets for the website

## Required Image Assets

For the website to display correctly, you'll need to add the following images to the `/public/images` directory:

1. `hero-bg.jpg` - A dark, atmospheric image for the hero section (recommended size: 1920x1080px)
2. `event1.jpg` through `event6.jpg` - Event cover images (recommended size: 800x600px)
3. `about-image.jpg` and `about-image2.jpg` - Images for the About section (recommended size: 800x600px)
4. `team-member1.jpg` through `team-member4.jpg` - Team member photos (recommended size: 400x500px)
5. `leaf-left.png` and `leaf-right.png` - Decorative leaf images (if desired, otherwise you can remove these from the code)

You can use placeholder images from services like Unsplash or Pexels with appropriate licenses for your needs.
